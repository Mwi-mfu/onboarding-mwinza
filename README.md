**ABOUT ME**  
NAME: Mwinza Mufune  
SCHOOL: School of Information, Communication and Technology  
YEAR of STUDY: Second(2)  
PROGRAMME: Computer Science  
  
I'm a tech enthusiast who has curiosities in various fields like cyber security, software development and operating systems; Linux to be specific (I use arch btw).  
  
**FUTURE PLANS IN TECH**  
Though uncertain about the future, I plan to pursue a career in either backend development or cyber security. Hopefully, I'll have an opportunity to use both.  
I'd like to learn low level programming, networking and automation. Additionally, I'd like to achieve a high level of mastery in backend development.  
In a period of 2 to 5 years, I see myself as an individual capable of developing and sercuring backend systems. One capable of cooperating with notable clients and players in the industry.
